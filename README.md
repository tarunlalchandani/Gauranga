A blockchain based autonomous decentralized application which facilitates the trade of old (used) bicycles.

In recent years, a trend of having personal bicycles has started among the students of our college which is evident from the continuously increasing number of bicycles on the campus. And surprisingly most of them are brand new bicycles, bought fresh from the market. The old system of buying ‘used’ bicycles has become out-of-date, either due to the communication gap in the student hierarchy system or the non-stop influx of newer models in the market which is leading to a bicycle-flood in the campus. This has given rise to two major problems - first, the increasing load on the infrastructure (cycle stands) to support and store these bicycles and second, wastage of money in buying fresh models when old ones could have been bought at a much lesser price.
As a solution, we have proposed a blockchain based business application which will facilitate the trade of ‘used’ bicycles. It will be extremely beneficial for the entire student community as it will act as the bridge where the buyers and the sellers of old bicycles can get in touch with each other directly without the interference of a third party (Peer to Peer architecture).

Scalability:
This decentralized platform can be scaled to facilitate the trading of any commodity which has the possiblity of being reused/reselled. It is the decentralized version of e-commerce tech giants such as OLX, Quikr etc.
